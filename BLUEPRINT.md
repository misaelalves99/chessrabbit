# Community architecture

ChessRabbit is a GPL-3.0 local chess database and training application. Every user can use every feature. Payments and subscription entitlements have been removed.

## Data flow

1. A static React interface runs in the browser on localhost.
2. FastAPI authenticates requests and stores games, studies, repertoires and jobs in PostgreSQL.
3. The API resolves the requested engine id against the worker's Redis catalog.
4. Jobs enter per-engine interactive or batch queues.
5. A worker acquires that profile's UCI subprocess and publishes evaluations over Redis.
6. The API relays live output over WebSocket; completed reviews persist in PostgreSQL.

Stockfish is included in the standard container. An optional CPU container builds Lc0. Native workers support platform-specific UCI binaries, including GPU Lc0. Configuration is read from a trusted JSON file or environment; browser requests cannot choose executables.

## Decisions

- Preserve the web UI instead of introducing a desktop wrapper. Docker provides a reproducible PC setup using the existing services.
- Default personal mode avoids registration and email setup. Bootstrap requires the configured localhost origin; public deployments use regular authentication.
- Use profile ids, engine versions, options and network hashes in cache identities. A one-line cached result cannot satisfy a request for several candidate lines.
- Keep depth, time, batch size and concurrency bounds as resource controls shared by all accounts.
- Preserve historical billing tables during upgrades; remove their models, routes, secrets and runtime readers.
- Retain the existing SQL migration history and append migration 016.

## Operational limits

The default engine pool has one process per profile. Long reviews can delay live requests; increase workers to reserve an interactive slot. Queue jobs are consumed with BLPOP and are not durable acknowledged jobs; a worker killed after dequeue can strand a job. A graceful failure is reported to the client, but automatic retry/recovery is future work.

Depth is not comparable across engines. Lc0 requires compatible weights and may hit its time limit before the requested depth. Neural networks, reference games, puzzles and tablebases are optional separate downloads.
