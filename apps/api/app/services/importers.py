"""
Auto-import games from Lichess / Chess.com public APIs (Sprint 2, 3.3).

Both platforms expose full game history without OAuth:
- Lichess:   GET https://lichess.org/api/games/user/{username}  (PGN stream)
- Chess.com: GET https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{u}/games/archives (JSON, monthly)

Sync strategy: newest games first, capped per sync (MAX_SYNC_GAMES); dedupe on
the platform's game URL stored in games.external_id. The free-tier storage cap
is respected - we import up to the remaining quota and report the rest as
"capped" so the UI can show an upgrade prompt exactly where value was denied.
