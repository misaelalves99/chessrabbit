"""
Player Insights: "how do YOU play?", aggregated across a player's own games.

Two passes, split by cost:

1. SQL, over every game matching the filter. Counts, win rates, openings,
   terminations, calendar - things Postgres can group far faster than Python.
2. A replay pass over the most recent `REPLAY_LIMIT` *reviewed* games. Anything
   that needs the board (which piece moved, when you castled, which phase a
   move fell in) or the eval curve (accuracy, game shape) is computed here,
   joining the stored engine annotations to the replayed position.

Only games with a known `user_color` are counted. A game we cannot attribute
would otherwise invert every win rate on the page, so it is excluded and the
response reports how many were skipped.
