"""
Tactics puzzle trainer.

Puzzles come from the Lichess open puzzle database (CC0): a FEN plus a UCI
solution line whose first move is the opponent's setup (played automatically),
after which the solver must find the rest. `/puzzles/next` serves one near the
player's tactics rating; `/puzzles/attempt` records the result and nudges that
rating Elo-style so difficulty tracks the player.

Solutions are sent to the client, which validates moves locally (standard for
puzzle trainers - the same is true on Lichess). The rating that matters is
updated server-side from the reported outcome.
