"""
Studies: the move tree, kept somewhere it can be shared.

What the browser already had was a tree that branches, comments and exports
PGN — and nowhere to put it. Lines lived in localStorage, so they belonged to
one browser and could not be shown to anybody. This router is the other half.

Two decisions shape everything below.

**A chapter is stored as PGN.** Not a node table. The browser's `pgn.ts` writes
movetext with variations, comments, NAGs and shape commands, and reads its own
output back; the server keeps that string and hands it back unchanged. So a
chapter leaves here into ChessBase or Lichess without a converter, and the tree
can learn to hold new things without a migration. The server does not parse it
on the write path — validating it would mean re-implementing the branch parser
in Python and disagreeing with the browser about some edge of the format, which
is a worse failure than storing movetext nobody can read.

**Reading and writing are governed separately.** `visibility` answers who may
read; `study_members` answers who may write. That is why there is no viewer
role: a viewer is somebody you sent the link to.
