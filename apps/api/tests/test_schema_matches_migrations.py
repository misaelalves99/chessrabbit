"""
The SQLAlchemy models and db/migrations/ describe the same database.

models.py opens by calling itself a mirror of the migrations. Nothing checked
that, and the two drift silently: a column added to a model but not to a
migration works perfectly in every test that never touches a real database, and
fails on the first query after deploy. A column added to a migration but not to
a model is quieter still - it simply goes unused until somebody wonders why the
data is never written.

This runs against the database CI builds by applying every migration in order,
so it is a test of the migrations as much as of the models: it is the reason
002-014 are executed at all, rather than 001 alone.

Skipped when CHESSRABBIT_TEST_DB is unset, which is how it stays out of the way
of a laptop with no Postgres on it. CI always sets it.
