/**
 * Every move in the game that went wrong, in the order it went wrong, as one
 * strip you can click through.
 *
 * The move list already contains this information, but it contains it the way a
 * transcript contains an argument: you have to read the whole thing to find the
 * four moves that mattered. Reviewing a game is not reading it start to finish —
 * it is going to the mistakes. This is that list, and nothing else.
 *
 * The chip IS the move number: `24??` is move 24, and the glyph is the verdict.
 * Move numbers are real sequence data, so they are doing the indexing here
 * rather than decorating it.
