/**
 * The Recall Rule — a slide rule for memory.
 *
 * This is the one place in the app allowed to be loud, and it earns it by
 * showing the thing the product actually does. SM-2 does not "mark you right";
 * it decides when you will see this position again, and that decision is the
 * whole value of drilling. Everywhere else that number is a sentence in small
 * grey text ("next review in 6 days") which nobody reads twice. Here it is a
 * brass scale with a needle on it, and answering moves the needle.
 *
 * Correct, and the needle travels right to its new interval. Wrong, and it
 * drops back to the first tick, which is exactly what the algorithm did to the
 * card. One motion, once per answer — this is the app's entire motion budget,
 * spent in the one spot where the movement IS the information.
 *
 * The scale itself lives in lib/recallScale.ts, where it can be tested: a
 * needle three pixels off still looks like a needle, so the maths does not get
 * to rely on someone noticing.

  // Two earlier versions of this held the start position in state and moved it
  // on mount, first with requestAnimationFrame and then with a timer. Both were
  // wrong in the same way: they made the travel an ENTRANCE rather than a
  // response, so the server-rendered markup showed the needle at the old
  // interval while the readout beside it already announced the new one. Anyone
  // whose JavaScript was still arriving read a rule that disagreed with its own
  // caption.

  // For the travel to animate, the caller must keep ONE instance across the
  // answer rather than swapping between two — see the note on /train.
