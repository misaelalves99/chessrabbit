/**
 * How each move verdict is drawn: the badge glyph, the badge fill, and the
 * text colour used in the move list.
 *
 * These used to be chess.com's review colours, borrowed on the grounds that
 * players arrive fluent in them. They are now derived from the app's own
 * palette instead, and the scale is built from two different mechanisms
 * because the two halves are not doing the same job:
 *
 *   THE GOOD HALF IS A CHROMA DECAY.  best is full verdigris; excellent is a
 *   paler wash of it; good is very nearly neutral sage. A move that was fine
 *   should fade out of the move list, not compete for attention with the one
 *   that lost the game.
 *
 *   THE BAD HALF IS A LIGHTNESS DESCENT.  inaccuracy is pale brass, mistake
 *   is brass, blunder is coral, and each step is a real drop in L*. Hue alone
 *   would collapse under red-green colour blindness; lightness does not.
 *
 * Book sits off the scale entirely, in chalk-blue: an opening move is not a
 * verdict, and colouring it anywhere on the verdigris-to-coral run would imply
 * a judgement that nobody made.
 *
 * Validated with apps/web/scripts/palette-check.py against the `panel` surface:
 * every good-half / bad-half pair holds ΔE >= 19 under protanopia, deuteranopia
 * and tritanopia, so "fine" and "trouble" can never be confused. excellent and
 * good DO collapse under deuteranopia (ΔE 6.8) and that is deliberate - they
 * both mean "non-event". Every verdict also carries its own glyph, so colour is
 * never the only channel.
