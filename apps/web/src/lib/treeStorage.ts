/**
 * Keeping the lines you explored across a reload.
 *
 * The tree is rebuilt from the PGN on every mount, so without this a refresh
 * throws away exactly what the tree was built to stop throwing away - the same
 * loss, moved from the move list to the page lifecycle.
 *
 * Two things make the stored form small and safe:
 *
 * Nothing derived is written. A node's FEN is sixty bytes of a position that
 * can be replayed from its parent in microseconds, and ply, depth and main-line
 * standing all fall out of where the move sits. Only the parent, the move, and
 * what a person added to it are worth keeping.
 *
 * A saved tree is adopted only if its main line still matches the game being
 * opened. Re-import a corrected PGN and the old variations would otherwise be
 * grafted onto moves they were never about - the same failure the review's
 * per-ply alignment check exists to prevent, arriving by a different route.
