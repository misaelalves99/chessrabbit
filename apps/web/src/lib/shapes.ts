/**
 * Arrows and circles drawn on the board, kept in the move's own comment.
 *
 * PGN has carried these since ChessBase put them there, as commands inside a
 * comment: `{the plan [%csl Gd4][%cal Gd2d4,Rf6e4]}`. Lichess reads and writes
 * the same thing, which is the reason to use it rather than a field of our own:
 * a chapter drawn here opens over there with its arrows intact, and a study
 * imported from there arrives with the author's.
 *
 * It also means shapes need no storage. `MoveNode.comment` already round-trips
 * through `pgn.ts`, `treeStorage.ts` and the server, so a shape written into it
 * is persisted, exported and synced by machinery that was already there and
 * does not have to learn what a shape is. This module is only the translation
 * between that string and something a renderer can use.
