/**
 * PGN movetext with variations, in both directions.
 *
 * chess.js is the only chess code allowed in the browser, and it reads and
 * writes the main line only - `( )` blocks are dropped silently on the way in
 * and never emitted on the way out, along with NAGs:
 *
 *   in   1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 (2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d3) 2... Nc6 {said so} 3. Bb5 $1 a6
 *   out  1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {said so} 3. Bb5 a6
 *
 * Which is exactly the half of the format a move tree is about. So the reading
 * and writing of branches lives here, over chess.js's move generation rather
 * than its parser. It is the same walk `prep.py` does server-side when it turns
 * a repertoire PGN into position cards, so the two agree on what a variation
 * means.
