# Development

Use Python 3.12 and Node.js 22. The default Docker stack serves a built static interface. For frontend development, stop the web container and run `npm ci` followed by `npm run dev` in `apps/web`. Its default API/WebSocket URLs point to localhost:8000.

API dependencies: `apps/api/requirements-dev.txt`. Engine dependencies: `services/engine/requirements.txt`. A native API uses DATABASE_URL with asyncpg, REDIS_URL pointing at port 6380, and LOCAL_MODE=true for personal use. APP_BASE_URL must match the browser origin. Keep credentials in ignored environment files.

## Checks

```sh
# repository root, in an activated Python environment
pip install -r apps/api/requirements-dev.txt -r services/engine/requirements.txt
ruff check apps/api services/engine pipeline
python -m pytest services/engine/tests -q

# apps/api
python -m pytest -q

# apps/web
npm ci
npx tsc --noEmit --incremental false
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Set CHESSRABBIT_TEST_DB to a migrated PostgreSQL test database to include schema reflection checks. Never point it at an unrelated live database. Docker initializes all migrations on a fresh volume; existing volumes need new migrations applied manually.

Engine tests exercise UCI handshakes, Lc0-style options, subprocess exit errors, registry availability and network cache identities with a deterministic test subprocess. Actual Stockfish smoke testing runs in CI. A real Lc0/network deployment must also be verified on the target CPU/GPU.

Use `python scripts/smoke_local.py` against a running default Docker stack to verify personal session bootstrap, engine availability, position analysis and game reviews.
