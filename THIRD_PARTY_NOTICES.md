The interface bundles Latin WOFF2 font files. Their original copyright and
license texts are included in `apps/web/src/app/fonts/` beside the font files.

See Python requirement files, the npm lockfile and installed packages for all direct/transitive dependencies and their license texts. Container base images include additional operating-system packages and notices.

The default worker installs Debian's Stockfish package. Its package copyright/source information is available in the image and through https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/stockfish . The optional Lc0 Dockerfile builds upstream tag v0.32.1 from its source and submodules.

The Windows installer bundles the unmodified upstream Stockfish 19 universal x64 release. Its `src`, build scripts, documentation, AUTHORS, GPL text and networks from that release are preserved under `resources/runtime/stockfish`. The release's original archive and SHA-256 are also published alongside the installer. PostgreSQL 16.15 comes from EDB's Windows binary archive; its server and command-line third-party notices are preserved. The desktop runtime uses fakeredis in process instead of a separate Redis server. Electron's `LICENSE.electron.txt` and `LICENSES.chromium.html` remain beside the executable. Python dependency notices are collected in `resources/runtime/python-licenses`, with the dependency inventory beside them.

When redistributing images or engine binaries, preserve copyright/license notices and provide corresponding source and build material as required by their licenses. Links here are attribution; they are not a replacement for providing corresponding source for the exact binaries you distribute. The desktop release includes the ChessRabbit source archive and Windows build scripts.

Neural-network files, Syzygy tablebases, reference games and puzzle datasets are obtained separately. Check their licenses before redistribution. Lichess database releases document their data terms at https://database.lichess.org . Public availability of games does not by itself grant unrestricted redistribution rights.
